# üéØ FINAL HANDOFF - MyoDolores Keyboard Control Project

## CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST
**This project creates a KEYBOARD-CONTROLLED HUMANOID ROBOT DEMO**
- User wants arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) to control walking direction
- Requires PHYSICS-BASED simulation with balance and stability  
- ONLY solution: Train RL policy that follows velocity commands

## üß† COMPLETE MEMORY VERIFICATION

### ‚úÖ PROJECT UNDERSTANDING 
- **Goal**: Real-time keyboard control of MyoSkeleton humanoid
- **Challenge**: Physics makes direct control impossible - robot falls over
- **Solution**: RL policy trained to follow velocity commands while maintaining balance
- **Architecture**: Keyboard ‚Üí Velocity Commands ‚Üí RL Policy ‚Üí Joint Torques ‚Üí Physics

### ‚úÖ TECHNICAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE (5+ Hours)
1. **MyoSkeleton Model**: 324-joint humanoid in myo_model_internal/
2. **Motion Data**: 8,000+ H5 sequences in myo_data/ 
3. **Control Framework**: ASAP/HumanoidVerse RL training system
4. **Deployment Examples**: unitree_rl_gym real robot control patterns
5. **Physics Engine**: MuJoCo 3.2.4 with real-time simulation

### ‚úÖ ENVIRONMENT STATUS
- **Repository**: /home/ubuntu/MyoDolores/ - All submodules present
- **Conda Environment**: myodolores (currently myoavatar due to rename issues)
- **MuJoCo**: 3.2.4 installed and verified
- **Documentation**: 3 comprehensive files created

### ‚úÖ TODO LIST STATUS
- [x] Study myo_model structure (COMPLETED)
- [x] Understand myo_api trajectory format (COMPLETED) 
- [x] Examine motion data (COMPLETED)
- [x] Study RL frameworks (COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up training environment (COMPLETED)
- [ ] **Train RL policy - REQUIRES GPU MACHINE**
- [ ] Implement keyboard demo - AFTER TRAINING

## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS
**CANNOT PROCEED ON CURRENT MACHINE**
- No GPU for Isaac Gym training
- Need RTX 3090+ for 4096 parallel environments
- Training time: 8-10 hours

## üìã NEXT MACHINE CHECKLIST

### 1. ENVIRONMENT SETUP
```bash
# EXACT commands for next machine
conda create -n myodolores python=3.8
conda activate myodolores
pip install mujoco==3.2.4
pip install -e ASAP/
pip install -e ASAP/isaac_utils/  
pip install -e myo_api/
```

### 2. TRAINING COMMAND
```bash
python ASAP/humanoidverse/train_agent.py \
+simulator=isaacgym \
+exp=locomotion \
+robot=myoskeleton \
+rewards=loco/velocity_tracking \
+obs=loco/locomotion_obs_with_commands \
num_envs=4096 \
project_name=MyoDoloresDemo \
experiment_name=VelocityControl_Training
```

### 3. POST-TRAINING DEMO
```python
# 50Hz real-time control loop
while True:
    if key == 'UP': vel_cmd = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    elif key == 'DOWN': vel_cmd = [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0]  
    elif key == 'LEFT': vel_cmd = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
    elif key == 'RIGHT': vel_cmd = [0.0, 0.0, -1.0]
    
    obs[command_indices] = vel_cmd
    actions = trained_policy(obs)
    mj_data.ctrl[:] = actions
    mujoco.mj_step(mj_model, mj_data)
    time.sleep(0.02)  # 50Hz
```

## üìÅ DOCUMENTATION FILES
- **CLAUDE.md** - Complete project context (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **TRAINING_PLAN.md** - Detailed training instructions
- **MEMORY_SUMMARY.md** - Concise project overview  
- **FINAL_HANDOFF.md** - This critical handoff document

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS FOR NEXT CLAUDE
1. **NO SHORTCUTS EXIST** - RL training is mandatory
2. **DON'T TRY ALTERNATIVES** - Direct control, PD control, etc. all fail
3. **VELOCITY COMMANDS ARE KEY** - This is the proven architecture
4. **50Hz IS REQUIRED** - For responsive real-time control
5. **TRAINING TAKES 8-10 HOURS** - Plan accordingly

## üîÑ WHAT TO DO IMMEDIATELY
1. Read CLAUDE.md completely (contains full context)
2. Verify GPU availability and CUDA setup
3. Set up exact environment as specified above
4. Start ASAP training with MyoSkeleton
5. Implement keyboard demo after policy is trained

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
**The project is successful when:**
- User can press arrow keys
- MyoSkeleton humanoid walks in corresponding direction
- Real-time response (50Hz)
- Stable, balanced locomotion
- Physics-based simulation

## üß† TOTAL KNOWLEDGE PRESERVED
**Everything discovered in 5+ hours of analysis is documented.**
**Next Claude has complete context to succeed.**
**Ready for GPU machine transfer!** üöÄ
