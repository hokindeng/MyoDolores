## 🚀 Quick Start on Your Computer

### Option 1: Automated Setup
```bash
# Extract package
tar -xzf MyoDolores_KeyboardControl_v1.0.tar.gz
cd MyoDolores_KeyboardControl_v1.0

# Quick install (Linux/Mac)
./INSTALL.sh

# Windows: run INSTALL.bat instead
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Create environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate myodolores

# Validate installation
python validate_setup.py

# Test with pre-trained policy
python test_keyboard_demo.py
```

## 🎮 Demo Controls

**Arrow Keys:**
- **↑** Move forward
- **↓** Move backward
- **←** Turn left
- **→** Turn right
- **Space** Stop
- **Esc** Quit

## 📊 Expected Performance

### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, any CPU, integrated graphics
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU, 4+ CPU cores

### Training Time
- **Pre-trained policy**: Ready to use immediately
- **Re-training**: 10-30 minutes (GPU) / 30-60 minutes (CPU)

### Robot Performance
- ✅ **Forward walking**: 2-3 seconds stable locomotion
- ✅ **Real-time control**: 50Hz responsive control
- ✅ **Balance**: Maintains upright posture initially
- ⚠️ **Sharp turns**: May fall during aggressive maneuvers

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

```
Keyboard Input → Velocity Commands → RL Policy → Joint Torques → Physics Simulation
     ↑              [x, y, yaw]         ↓           133 DOF        ↓
  Arrow Keys                      PPO Neural Net                MuJoCo
```

**Key Components:**
- **PPO Policy**: 278 observations → 133 actions
- **MyoSkeleton**: Full human biomechanical model
- **MuJoCo 3.2.4**: High-fidelity physics simulation
- **Real-time**: 50Hz control loop for responsiveness

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

**Installation Issues:**
```bash
# Missing conda
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Python version issues
conda create -n myodolores python=3.8
```

**Runtime Issues:**
```bash
# GPU memory issues
export MUJOCO_GL=osmesa  # Use CPU rendering

# Import errors  
conda activate myodolores
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/myo_api:$PYTHONPATH"
```

**Performance Issues:**
```python
# In train_keyboard_control.py, reduce:
num_envs = 64  # For less memory usage
```

## 📈 Extending the Project

**Immediate Improvements:**
1. **Longer Training**: Increase `num_iterations` for better stability
2. **Better Rewards**: Tune reward weights for smoother walking
3. **More Commands**: Add sideways movement, crouching, jumping

**Advanced Features:**
1. **Terrain Variation**: Stairs, slopes, obstacles
2. **Multiple Gaits**: Walking, running, dancing
3. **Real Robot**: Deploy to physical humanoid
4. **VR Control**: Head tracking, hand gestures

## 💡 What Makes This Special

1. **Physics-Based**: Real biomechanical simulation, not scripted animation
2. **Learned Control**: RL policy handles complex balance and coordination
3. **Real-Time**: Immediate response to keyboard commands
4. **Transferable**: Works across different computers and platforms
5. **Educational**: Complete pipeline from training to deployment

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Robot stands upright**
✅ **Responds to arrow keys** 
✅ **Walks forward for 2+ seconds**
✅ **Real-time 50Hz control**
✅ **Physics-based simulation**

## 📞 Support
